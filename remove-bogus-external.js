 * Script to clean up Actions incorrectly marked as 'external'.

 * duplicate actions being recorded in the DB as 'external'. The expected case
 * from the bug was that we would execute a subscription block or auto-block,
 * then sometime later observe that block and treat it as a new one. However,
 * this script also catches a number of duplicate blocks caused by users
 * deactivating and reactivating (see
 * https://github.com/jsha/blocktogether/issues/180).
