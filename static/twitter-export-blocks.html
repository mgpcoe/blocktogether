<h3>Exporting and Importing Blocks directly from Twitter</h3>
<p>
Wed Jun 10 11:23 PDT 2015 - by <a href="https://twitter.com/j4cob">Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</a>
<p>
Today, Twitter announced native support for
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/sharing-block-lists-to-help-make-twitter-safer"
>importing and exporting lists of blocked user ids</a>.
This brings functionality like Block Together's and
<a href="https://twitter.com/theblockbot">The Block Bot's</a> into
twitter.com. I'm very excited about this feature. It shows Twitter is
working hard on giving people better tools to help defend each other against
harassment.
<p>
Twitter's block list export is missing some important features, relative to Block
Together. Because Twitter relies on a one-time block export, there is no way to
<a href="https://blocktogether.org/#propagating-forgiveness">propagate
forgiveness</a>. That is, the author of a block list may decide they made
a mistake blocking a given account. On Block Together, an author can unblock, and the
subscribers of their block list will automatically unblock too.
<p>
Similarly, Twitter doesn't offer ongoing subscriptions. As harassers bring new
accounts online, the author of a block list can block the new accounts. But
unless the author's community downloads and imports the block list regularly,
community members won't automatically receive the new blocks.
<p>
Lastly, Twitter doesn't offer an easy way to publish a block list, once it is
exported. With easy services like Pastebin, this is not a big problem, but it
adds one more obstacle when sharing a block list.
<p>
Twitter's implementation does have some big advantages. By
incorporating the feature into Twitter's web UI, Twitter can bring
block lists to the many people who would not otherwise have come
across them.  By using Twitter's resources to translate their import/export
interface into many languages, Twitter can make block lists accessible to people
all over the world. And Twitter's large engineering team means they can
build a better, faster product that will scale to millions of users.
<p>
I anticipate that Twitter will continue improving their block list
feature. Someday, when Twitter offers all of Block Together's features,
I look forward to recommending their built-in features over Block
Together. In the meantime, I'm thrilled to see more anti-abuse tools in the
hands of individuals. Congratulations to
<a href="https://twitter.com/XiaoyunZhang1">Xiaoyun Zhang</a> and the rest
of the anti-abuse team at Twitter on a very important feature launch!
